# Spring-DB
This Spring-based application retrieves an information from PostgreSQL.

Branch "main" consists of a Spring-based application and a hand-made JDBC statements and connections with parsing ResultSets, built my very own command parser, added some AOP for logging purposes. Also there is a support for internationalization.

Branch "laba3" is basically the same, but built on Spring Boot with Spring shell.
